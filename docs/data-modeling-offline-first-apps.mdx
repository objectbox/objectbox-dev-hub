# Data Modeling for Offline-First Apps

Designing a robust data model is the foundation of any offline-first app. This guide shows pragmatic patterns that work well with ObjectBox across mobile and edge environments: entity boundaries, relations, denormalization, converters, and schema stability.

## Entities & fields

Model each real-world concept as an **Entity** with a stable schema. Favor **explicit, typed fields** over generic JSON blobs to keep indexes fast and queries predictable.

- Keep entity responsibilities cohesive (one concept per entity).
- Use `@Index` on frequently filtered/sorted fields.
- Prefer primitive types where possible.

## Relations

ObjectBox supports **one-to-one**, **one-to-many**, and **many-to-many** relations.

- **1:1**: Reference the related object’s ID or use a relation field (binding-specific).
- **1:n**: Use `ToMany` or a relation list.
- **m:n**: Depending on the language binding, model with relation entities or reciprocal `ToMany`. Document which binding you target and keep the relation consistent across entities.

- Load-by-ID when you already know the IDs (cheaper than full queries).
- For write-heavy use cases, consider **denormalized read fields** to avoid joins.

## Denormalization (read-optimized views)

In offline-first apps, **derived, read-only fields/lists** are practical:
- Keep authoritative data normalized (single write source of truth).
- Maintain **derived views** (e.g., “inbox preview”) as precomputed fields updated on writes.
- Document the update rules where the denormalized field is defined.

This avoids expensive joins/queries on the hot path and simplifies rendering on constrained devices.

## Indexes & query planning

- Index fields used in `WHERE`, sorting, or pagination.
- Avoid “indexing everything”—each index adds write overhead.
- When drilling down via multiple filters, test the most selective index first (or rely on the binding’s query planner if available).

## Converters

Use **Converters** to map complex/unsupported types (e.g., `LocalDateTime`, enums with custom codes) to persistable primitives.

- Keep converters **pure** and **invertible**.
- Prefer encodings that remain stable across versions (e.g., epoch seconds, ISO-8601 strings, or small integers for enums).

## IDs & schema stability

- **IDs**: By default, ObjectBox assigns IDs on insert; if you need to set IDs yourself, use assignable IDs (see language-specific docs).
- **@Uid**: Use stable `@Uid` values on entities/fields to avoid migration conflicts across branches.
- Avoid renaming fields lightly; if you must, keep a migration note.

## Transactions & bulk operations

Use a transaction for **logical groups of writes** (e.g., importing 10k items, batch sync). Keep transactions **short** to reduce lock contention on mobile.

- Batch `put`/`remove` within a single transaction where it makes sense.
- Handle errors inside the transaction and fail fast.

## Offline sync boundaries

For devices that sync, design entities with **clear sync ownership**:
- Mark fields that are **device-local only** (not synced).
- Keep **conflict-prone data** isolated or denormalized to ease conflict resolution.
- Consider a **change-log** entity for auditability and retries.

## Testing & evolution

- Seed test data reflecting production cardinalities and edge cases (nullables, long strings, large collections).
- Snapshot and restore stores for reproducible benchmarks.
- Document schema changes alongside code changes.
