This page is an ObjectBox [companion guide for the MongoDB Data Sync tutorial by Fidaa B. (from MongoDB)](https://dev.to/mongodb/mongodb-data-sync-for-offline-first-apps-keep-data-in-sync-with-objectbox-and-mongodb-atlas-34k8) with quick navigation, production caveats, and troubleshooting pointers.
The tutorial shows how to use ObjectBox on the device for fast offline-first reads/writes, run ObjectBox Sync Server as the sync engine, and connect it to MongoDB Atlas via the MongoDB Sync Connector to keep local and cloud data in sync.

## Architecture at a glance

MongoDB Atlas ↔ ObjectBox Sync Server ↔ ObjectBox (mobile/edge clients)

- Clients keep working offline using the local ObjectBox database.
- The Sync Server coordinates changes and syncs bidirectionally with MongoDB via the connector.

## Quickstart (fast route)

* [Start with the MongoDB tutorial](https://dev.to/mongodb/mongodb-data-sync-for-offline-first-apps-keep-data-in-sync-with-objectbox-and-mongodb-atlas-34k8)

* Keep these ObjectBox references open

	- [Sync Server configuration](https://sync.objectbox.io/sync-server/configuration)

## Production notes (the stuff that bites later)

### MongoDB connection & primary DB discipline

- The connector needs a MongoDB connection string and a **primary MongoDB database name**.
- After a full sync in a given environment, avoid switching the primary database unless you plan a reset/re-sync (especially during development).

### Prefer config files for non-trivial setups

For anything beyond basic settings, use a configuration file approach (repeatable, reviewable, and easier to automate).

### Offline reality: plan for long gaps

Assume devices can be offline for days/weeks. Document your approach to:

- conflict strategy
- schema evolution/migrations
- monitoring / backlog visibility

### Security & access

Treat Sync Server as production infrastructure:

- restrict admin endpoints
- define required client auth methods
- keep secrets in runtime config (not baked into images)

## FAQ (starter set)

### How does bidirectional sync work here?

Changes flow between ObjectBox clients and MongoDB in both directions via the Sync Server + connector.

### Where do I configure MongoDB URL / DB name?

Either via CLI parameters (e.g. `--mongo-url`, `--mongo-db`) or in the Sync Server configuration file.

### What should I monitor in production?

At minimum: sync backlog/latency, connector logs, server resource usage, and error/retry rates.
