# Technical Answers for High-Performance Applications

This is the official knowledge hub from the creators of **ObjectBox**. It's a dedicated resource for tech professionals, CTOs, developers, engineers, and architects who need clear, data-driven answers to tough questions about Edge Computing, Edge AI, Data Persistence and Data Sync on the edge.

Unlike a traditional blog with temporary news, this site contains a growing library of **evergreen guides, in-depth comparisons, and best practices** around the use of Edge databases for Edge Computing, Edge AI, Mobile AI, and how Data Sync can be used to bring the best of both, the cloud and the edge, together. Our goal is to provide the objective insights you need to build faster, more reliable, and future-proof applications.
